# nba-api_data
Project to extract data from the 2021-22 NBA season (Regular season and Playoffs) to identify player's shooting pattern.

To do so, we will get the data from the nba_api package for Python, then retrieve data from certain endpoints from the API to gather shooting, playdate, and games information. 

Later, we will upload the extracted Dataframes to a MySQL database using the SQLAlchemy library, which allows us to import straight from Pandas.
